📘 SOP: Extend Amazon EBS Volume with LVM and XFS – /dev/vg01/lvol04 on /dev/nvme1n1
🧾 Purpose
This document outlines the steps to safely extend an Amazon EBS volume that uses LVM with an XFS filesystem. This SOP applies to the volume /dev/nvme1n1, configured as a physical volume for the logical volume /dev/vg01/lvol04 mounted on /data.

✅ Prerequisites
The size of the EBS volume /dev/nvme1n1 has already been increased via the AWS Console or CLI.

The filesystem on /dev/vg01/lvol04 is XFS.

The volume is mounted at /data.

You have SSH access to the EC2 instance.

🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions
🔹 Step 1: Connect to the Instance
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh ec2-user@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS>
🔹 Step 2: Confirm the New Size is Detected
bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk
Verify that /dev/nvme1n1 reflects the newly increased size.

If it's not reflected:

Run sudo nvme list to verify device status.

If resizing still doesn’t appear, consider a reboot after snapshot backup.

🔹 Step 3: Resize the Physical Volume
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo pvresize /dev/nvme1n1
This command tells LVM to recognize the additional space now available on /dev/nvme1n1.

🔹 Step 4: Extend the Logical Volume
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg01/lvol04
This allocates all remaining free space in the volume group vg01 to lvol04.

🔹 Step 5: Resize the XFS Filesystem
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo xfs_growfs /data
✅ This step must be performed while /data is mounted, and only works with XFS filesystems.

🔍 Verification
After completion, verify space expansion:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -h /data
sudo lvs
sudo vgs
🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips
Issue	Resolution
pvresize fails	Ensure the EBS volume resize was successful and OS reflects the new size.
xfs_growfs: not an XFS filesystem	Ensure /data is using XFS: df -T /data
Space doesn’t increase after all steps	Re-run lsblk, pvdisplay, lvdisplay to confirm changes at each layer
Volume is not mounted	Use `mount

📂 Complete Command Summary
bash
Copy
Edit
# Connect to the instance
ssh ec2-user@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_DNS>

# Check current block devices
lsblk

# Resize physical volume
sudo pvresize /dev/nvme1n1

# Extend logical volume
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg01/lvol04

# Grow XFS filesystem
sudo xfs_growfs /data

# Verify
df -h /data
sudo lvs
📝 Notes
Take an EBS snapshot backup before performing this operation.

These steps are non-disruptive and require no downtime if the volume is not root.

Applicable only for XFS filesystems.
