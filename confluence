📘 How to Create a Windows AMI Using “Import Image” in EC2 Image Builder (via VHD)
This guide explains how to use the Import Image feature in AWS EC2 Image Builder to create a Windows AMI from a VHD/VHDX file stored in S3, without requiring pipelines or image recipes.

🧾 Prerequisites
Ensure the following:

A generalized (Sysprepped) Windows VHD/VHDX file.

VHD is uploaded to an S3 bucket in the same AWS region.

You have sufficient AWS permissions to use EC2 Image Builder.

An IAM role is available with necessary permissions to import the image from S3.

📂 Step 1: Upload the VHD to Amazon S3
Create the bucket if not already present:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 mb s3://your-vhd-bucket-name
Upload the VHD file:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp ./your-image.vhd s3://your-vhd-bucket-name/your-image.vhd
🔐 Step 2: Create the IAM Role for EC2 Image Import
If you do not already have a role, follow these steps to create one.

📄 Trust Policy
Create a trust relationship that allows Image Builder to assume the role:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "imagebuilder.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
You can create the role using the AWS CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name EC2ImageBuilderImportRole \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
📄 Permissions Policy
Attach a policy with the following required actions:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "ec2:ImportImage",
        "ec2:RegisterImage",
        "ec2:DescribeImages",
        "ec2:DescribeImportImageTasks",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "ec2:CopySnapshot"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Attach it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam put-role-policy \
  --role-name EC2ImageBuilderImportRole \
  --policy-name EC2ImageImportPermissions \
  --policy-document file://permissions-policy.json
🔐 Step 3: Update S3 Bucket Policy (Optional but Recommended)
If the S3 bucket is not public or cross-account, add a policy that allows Image Builder’s role to access the VHD file.

Replace ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS Account ID:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowImageBuilderAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/EC2ImageBuilderImportRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-vhd-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-vhd-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Apply this to your bucket using the console or CLI.

🧱 Step 4: Use “Import Image” in EC2 Image Builder Console
Go to EC2 Image Builder in the AWS Console.

From the sidebar, go to Images > AMIs.

Click Import Image.

Fill out the form:

S3 URI: s3://your-vhd-bucket-name/your-image.vhd

Format: VHD or VHDX

OS: Match the OS version used in your image (e.g., Windows Server 2019)

IAM Role: Select the role created above (EC2ImageBuilderImportRole)

(Optional) Add tags or AMI name/version

Click Import Image to begin the process.

⏱️ Step 5: Monitor Import Progress
In the Image Builder > AMIs section, locate the image.

The status will show as Creating or Pending.

Once completed, the status will change to Available, and the AMI will be registered in EC2.

You can also monitor progress with the CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks
🖼️ Step 6: Launch an EC2 Instance
Go to EC2 > AMIs > Owned by me

Select the newly created AMI

Click Launch Instance

🧽 Cleanup (Optional)
Remove the VHD file from S3 if no longer needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 rm s3://your-vhd-bucket-name/your-image.vhd
Delete the IAM role if it's no longer required.

✅ Notes
This import method supports BYOL (Bring Your Own License).

The VHD must be Sysprepped before upload.

VHD format must be compatible with EC2 (no encrypted disks or nested partitions).

No build pipelines, components, or recipes are required for this process.

Let me know if you want this exported in Markdown, HTML, or Confluence Wiki Markup for direct upload.
